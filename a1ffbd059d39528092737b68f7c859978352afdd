It is currently available on the Intel Linux fork, here: https://github.com/Intel-BMC/linux/blob/dev-5.15-intel/include/uapi/linux/peci-ioctl.h#L36.\n\nMy understanding is after the new PECI driver becomes available, we will begin to phase out libpeci as applications get converted to the new driver.",
